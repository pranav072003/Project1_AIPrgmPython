# Project1_AIPrgmPython
In this project, I am using my basic python programming skills to be able to read content from files and thus be able to use a pre-trained image classifier for distinguishing dog images. I am also creating some metrics to measure the accuracy of the classifier using in-depth knowledge of available data structures in Python like dictionaries, lists, tuples, etc
